def get_normalized_total(df, reference, ambiguous):
    """
    Feature generation function which generates missing data binary indicators for two numeric features, and moves
    values from an ambiguous column to a new column, based on whether a reference column is not missing or
    is different than zero.

    The missing data binary indicators are named with the former reference and ambiguous column names appended with the
    prefix '_missing'.

    The ambiguous values related to the non-zero reference values are moved to a new column appended with the reference
    column name.  After moving the value, the original columns is filled with a missing value NaN.

    Finally, those column types are downcast to the smallest float possible to reduce memory usage.

    :param reference: the reference column
    :param ambiguous: the ambiguous columns
    :return: a dataframe (copy) with the three new columns and the moved/imputed values
